Project Workflow:

1. Data Exploration:
Understanding the Target Variable:
Check the distribution of the target variable (Attrition_Flag) to see if the classes are balanced or imbalanced.
Determine the percentage of each class within the target variable.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Handling Missing Values:
Check for missing or null values in the dataset and handle them appropriately (imputation, removal, etc.).

Encoding Categorical Variables:
Convert categorical variables (like 'Gender', 'Education_Level', 'Marital_Status', etc.) into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

3. Feature Selection/Engineering:
Correlation Analysis:
Explore correlations between different features and the target variable. This helps in understanding which features might have stronger relationships with the target.

4. Modelling::
Model Selection:
Choose an appropriate model based on the problem (classification, regression) and your dataset characteristics.
Common models for classification problems include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.

Train-Test Split:
Split your dataset into training and testing sets to train the model on a subset and evaluate its performance on unseen data.

5. Model Evaluation:
Evaluation Metrics:
Use appropriate evaluation metrics for classification problems such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.
Evaluate your model's performance on the test set using these metrics.

6. Model Improvement:
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Optimize your model by tuning hyperparameters to improve its performance.
This is a broad overview. Depending on the specific problem and data characteristics, additional steps or variations may be required in this process. For instance, dealing with class imbalance, feature scaling, cross-validation, and ensembling techniques can also be crucial.
